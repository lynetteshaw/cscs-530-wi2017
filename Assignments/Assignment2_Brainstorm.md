# Project Brainstorm and Literature Review 
##**Due Weds., 2/8 via Canvas Dropbox**
&nbsp; 

The purpose of this assignment is to help you start honing in on the model you will be building for your course project. As mentioned in the syllabus, the hope for this class is that you will end up building something that will be useful to you in your subsequent research. Ultimately though, the decision of what to focus on and build is entirely up to you.

## Topic Identification (1 paragraph)

Provide a quick overview of the phenomena or systems that you are interested in modeling. Address the following questions:
+ Why do you think complex systems might be relevant to this topic ?  
+ How do you think an ABM approach might further our understanding of it? 
+ What do you hope to achieve with your model?

&nbsp;

## Literature Review (2-3 paragraphs)

Provide a brief summary of some of the papers or literatures that you think will be most relevent to your model. Of particular importance will be the substantive information you expect to use to design of your agents, interactions, and environments. In your research, you will also want to be especially diligent in seeking out any potentially relevant computational models that others have used to represent the system you are interested in (or systems that might be closely related to it).

Bear in mind the tradeoffs involved in picking subjects which have not been modeled previously. Choosing something that hasn't been modeled before might allow you to be a lot more innovative but will likely prove to be more work than the alternative scenario in which you can modify or extend an existing set of models.

## Approach (2-3 paragraphs)

In this final part of the assignment, sketch out some ideas on how  you might translate the topic of interest into an ABM. Consider the following questions in your discussion: 
+ What will be the agents in the model?
+ What sorts of interactions do you think will be most important and what sort of interaction topology do you think will be most appropriate to use? 
+ What will be the role of the environment? 
+ Will you need to design everything from scratch or do you anticipate being able to modify or extend existing models (either from the literature you have reviewed or by identifying a potentially "analagous"  model from a different discipline or area)? 
+ What will be the modeling outcomes you are most interested in measuring and understanding?
