## Assignment 1: NetLogo Practice Exercises
## Due: Wednesday, 1/25/2017 via Canvas Dropbox


**Instructions**

Submit Netlogo files (you should have a total of 4) AND one separate document with your written responses via Canvas Dropbox. All exercises are taken from the “Explorations” sections at the end of chapters 3 and 4 in *An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling* by Wilensky and Rand.

 
 

**From Chapter 3**

**8.**  Ants with multiple pheromones As mentioned in its Info tab, the Ants model focuses on the problem of food foraging, and assumes that ants can always find their own way directly back to the nest using a perfectly distributed predefined nest-scent gradient, once they have found the food. To make the model more physically plausible, change it so that the nest-scent is a new kind of pheromone that is released by ants for some limited time period after they have left the nest. This nest-scent pheromone should diffuse and evaporate just like the food-carrying pheromone does.	
 
 


**From Chapter 4**

**7.** The Wolf Sheep Simple model explores two animal species interacting, but most ecologies have many more animal species. Create a third species in the model. One interesting way to do this would be to create a species that competes with the wolves for sheep, and can also eat wolves and be eaten by wolves. Can you get this three species ecosystem to stabilize?

**22.** Spatial location and grass In the Wolf Sheep Simple model, the grass is randomly distributed across the space. However it is more realistic that areas of grass are spatially collocated, that is, areas with more grass are likely to be near each other, and areas low in grass are near each other. Change the SETUP and/or GO procedure for the grass to reflect this. How does this change affect the model? How does it affect the sheep?

**18.** Building a simple model from a textual description Now that you know how to build a simple model, can you build one that someone else has described? For instance, imagine you read the following in a scientific paper: “ Agents are placed randomly throughout the world. Each agent has a status of either being healthy or sick. At the start of the model all agents are healthy except for one. Each time step agents move locally to a new random location. If, after they move, there are any agents that are sick nearby then they become sick. ” Build this model. Is it specified with sufficient detail that you believe your model is the same as the model built by the authors of the scientific paper?
